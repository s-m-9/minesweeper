My Minesweeper Plan


How to create the board
    1. get length number, get width number
    2. create board length x width maybe an array[row][column]
        a. build it on board, filling with zeros
    3. randomly add n number of bombs to the board
        a. adds incrementation around it
            i.    Top-Left:     [0, 0]
            ii.   Top:          [0, 1]
            iii.  Top-Right:    [0, 2]
            iv.   Right:        [1, 2]
            v.    Bottom-Right: [2, 2]
            vi.   Bottom:       [2, 1]
            vii.  Bottom-Left:  [1, 1]
            viii. Left:         [0, 1]
        b. check to see if incrementation is out of range


End game condition 
    1. The player clicks all the non-bomb infested squares
    2. The player clicks a bomb infested square
    

Coding Requirements:
    1. The map should not be stored on the client side, to prevent the player from cheating.
        a. Board Created in Python
        b. View Created in Javascript
            i. only have knowledge of how big the board is, which is probably hardcoded
    2. When clicking on a box, an AJAX request should be sent to the server to determine the current status of the field and update it accordingly.
        a. User clicks a box, coordinates are sent to the server. (POST)
        b. The server then checks board, and sees the status, returns it, and game logic is stored on the server
    3. Game states should be stored on the server such that the player can get back to a game by going to the game's URL.
        a. moves are recorded by server
        b. url contains the id of game, so it can load the state of board if travelled to.
